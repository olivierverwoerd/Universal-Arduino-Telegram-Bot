# Universal Telegram Bot Library FOR ETHERNET ARDUINO's
Hi this is exactly the same repo as ![this](https://github.com/witnessmenow/Universal-Arduino-Telegram-Bot) but transformed for ethernet arduino's. 
Wires are better anyways

Why like this? Well, it was a quick fix to have a simple library like the Universal Telegram Bot Library but with the connection like ![AsyncTelegram2](https://github.com/cotestatnt/AsyncTelegram2)
